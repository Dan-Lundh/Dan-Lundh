## Dan Lundh Portfolio ðŸ‘‹

Extensive experience in data processing, drawing conclusions, producing and implementing software/system solutions, analysing results, and summarising findings both verbally and in written form.

### Core Competencies
Technical Skills Machine learning, deep learning, large language models (LLM), data analytics, data engineering, big data, ETL, ELT, data storytelling, Python, C, C#, R, Perl, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Git, GitHub, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, SQL, GitHub Actions, HTML, statistical analysis 

### Sample Project Solutions
* Using [deep learning](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh) to check you projecty budget, indicating if you have problems like to little or to much activity within e.g. project management, technique, data engineering, Ux/UI, or QA/testing. 
* AI tool for [evaluating projects](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/project-eval-tool) and giving suggestions of how to improve the project proposal, working by the Google Gemini LLM.
* AI Application using [speech to text](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/speech2text-cmd) (fairly realtime), with sample of voice commands to control the app.The app takes the input and finds similar projects (using a chromaDB with faiss) i.e. using RAG (with filtering and selction), to be sent of to Google Gemini (LLM). 
* Smart home applications in Python, [primarily APIs](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/API-Collection), to enable device control based on factors such as weather conditions and electricity spot prices
* AI Applications for different purposes such as [AI-based predictions](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/Ice-cream-prediction), [full-stack development](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/Youtube-db), [deep learning](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/AI-deep_learning), dashboards, [storytelling](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/Supahcoolsoft), AI, [and LLMs (Large Language Models)](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/chatrobot-gbg)
* [problem-solving](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/netanalysis) in masters thesis projects
* Analysis of motion data ([GAIT data](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/Gait_analysis_Mindius), 3D data)
* [Surface and forces](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/Surface)
* [C#/SQL in Blazor with functionality for UX](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/myOLF)
* Simple test of [Google Gemini with RAG - API](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/RAG-LLM) 
* AI [Deep learning MLP to detect fall, realtime predictions ](https://github.com/Dan-Lundh/Falldetector)
